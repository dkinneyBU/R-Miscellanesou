## All Grammatical Elements

Element     | Description
------------|------------------------------------------------------
Data        | The dataset being plotted.
Aesthetics  | The scales onto which we *map* our data.
Geometries  | The visual elements used for our data.
Facets      | Plotting small multiples.
Statistics  | Representations of our data to aid our understanding.
Coordinates | The space on which the data will be plotted.
Themes     | All non-data ink.

!Graphical Layers][layers]

# Limitations of the Base plotting function
1. Plot is not redrawn when adding layering (dangerous!)
2. Plot is drawn as an image (not an object)
3. Need to manually add a legend
4. No unified framework for plotting

```
** Useful base functions **
lm() - linear model
abline() - used to plot a linear model
lapply() - vectorize over a variable

Example:
carModel <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
abline(carModel, lty = 2)
lapply(mtcars$cyl, function(x) {
  abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars, subset = (cyl == x)), col = x)
})
```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
